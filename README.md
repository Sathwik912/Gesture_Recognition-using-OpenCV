# Gesture_Recognition-using-OpenCV
Gesture-Controlled Servo Motor project combines computer vision and hardware interfacing to create an interactive system. Using hand gestures  captured by a webcam, users can control the position of a servo motor in real- time.


#Software Libraries
Python 3.7-3.9
OpenCV
mediapipe
pyFirmata

Note: Python version 3.7-3.9 is chosen for this project due to its compatibility with the pyFirmata library, which is crucial for communication between the computer and Arduino board.
